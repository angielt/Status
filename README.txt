This app utilizes:

	XCode
	Swift
	Google Firebase
	Apple HealthKit
	


I am aiming to create a health care application that focuses on maintaining the 
equilibrium and balance of a person's every day life. 

Ideally, a person should use up the consumed calories by the end of the day in order to 
maintain a healthy weight. With the increased amounts of processed foods and trending super foods,
people are going to the extremes with both weight gain and weight loss in an unhealthy way.

This app will help keep track of the calories and macros consumed and recommend exercises 
to help burn off the extra calories or foods to increase the calories depending on the needs
of the individual.
